	<h1>Yao's webzone</h1>
	<div class="doc-capsule">
		<p>hi there! it's me, Yao aka Ennis aka "Aubrey", and you've found my
			little home on the web!</p>
		<p>I'm a writer working on the Hyperion Union sci-fi setting, as well
			as an artist, programmer, conlang creator, and Maker of Symbols. I
			have a background of study in multiple science fields, which tends
			to leak into my writing a fair bit</p>
		<p>honestly, there's not going to be a ton here just this second, but
			I can give a little contact info and such...</p>
		<h2>social thingies</h2>
		<p><a href="https://chitter.xyz/@yaodema">@yaodema@chitter.xyz</a>: my
			little home on the mastoverse</a></p>
		<p>... that's it, currently. I *have* a tumblr, but I haven't used it
			in years. <strong>I do not have a twitter, it is deleted. I will
			never go back there.</strong>
		<p>maybe I'll add some others here eventually</p>
		<h2>symbols</h2>
		<p>I made two symbols I rather like, that seem to speak to a bunch of
			other people too! I'll list them here, and you can look at their
			pages for info on their inspiration and (simple) licensing.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="./tf-hazard/">transformation hazard</a></li>
			<li><a href="./self-replication-hazard/">self-replication
				hazard</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>RSS feed</h2>
		<p style="font-size:smaller">well really it's Atom but that's normal
			in 202X...</p>
		<p>if you've got one, your feed reader should pick it up with a click,
			but if not, <a href="./atom.xml">here's the link!</a></p>
		<p>I'll be updating this with the contents of a blog eventually. the
			first few entries will be when major updates to the site happen,
			then I'll start moving my writing over. reposts will be clearly
			marked in the RSS feed, and require a click-through to see them.</p>
		<h2>other plans?</h2>
		<p>yes! eventually there'll be an art gallery here, at least one comic,
			and even a way to leave comments and send asks! maybe I'll fit this
			place with webmention, or maybe something more exotic... we'll see
			what the future may hold, there.</p>
