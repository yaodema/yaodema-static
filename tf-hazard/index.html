		<p>"tf hazard" for short</p>
		<p>I created this symbol on 14 Aug 2022, and posted it online, first
			on Twitter, then months later on Cohost. the response I got in
			those and other places was so powerful, I figured it should be
			useful to a fair few people! now, I'm giving it a permanent
			home, here on my own webzone!</p>
		<p>this is intended for use on anything that may pose a risk of
			transformation occurring when interacting with it. the symbol is
			inspired by existing trefoil hazard symbols, the crescent moon
			(commonly symbolizing change), as well as the alchemical symbol for
			projection (aka transmutation), which is pisces ♓︎</p>
		<p>the file here is 1200 wide, which should be enough for most purposes.
			in world I expect this to often be a fluorescent green, but any
			contrasting color should be readable. the exact color chosen here
			was so it'd print fine (CMY percents are in the filename)</p>
		<p>if you want to use it yourself, in things you make, just make sure
			you credit me for making it! linking back to this page would be
			best, and the name "yaodema" is what I go by almost everywhere
			online</p>
		<p>one thing to note: <strong>do not sell the symbol by
			itself.</strong> it's fine to put the warning on things in your art
			where it'd be appropriate, or to put the symbol prominently on a
			vial of something for a bit, and people have done this before. I've
			been quite happy with every case I've seen of it in the wild, so
			far! just, don't sell stickers or magnets or something with the
			symbol on it. thank you!</p>
		<p>(this is essentially CC-BY, but with an extra clause that forbids
			selling the symbol <em>by itself,</em> or as the whole point of the
			thing being sold.)</p>
		<p>also, I keep getting asked about tattoos of this, so yes, if you
			want it on your body, go right ahead! (to allow this, tattoo
			artists are of course allowed to put the symbol on someone's body,
			if that someone requests it)</p>
		<p>hope you enjoy!</p>
