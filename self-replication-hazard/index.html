		<p>since my setting demands a warning symbol like this, I had this one
			kicking around inside my brain for about a year, alongside the
			transformation hazard. it finally got released on 15 Mar 2024, over
			on cohost</p>

		<p>this is a symbol to indicate a self-replication hazard, usually of a
			non-biological origin. ever-smaller circles budding off a central
			starting point evoke the similarities to replication of living
			cells. the three-fold symmetry follows with traditional abstract
			warning signs</p>
		<p>while the elements of, say, a nanobot swarm, may themselves be made
			of the same stuff as living things, there are key differences that
			normally prevent them from replicating without bound; just in case
			they go beyond those bounds, it's a good idea to have this warning 
			handy! (also an autoclave. maybe some caustic cleaners for good
			measure.)</p>
		<p>there's no standard warning color for this one, so I've produced
			versions in black lines and white lines, for maximum contrast on
			any background. dark mode and light mode users might see an
			apparently blank image for one of these. both are 1200 pixels wide,
			as is becoming a standard for me with these. (yes, there are SVG
			versions, too, but I'm not ready to release those yet)</p>
		<p>as is the case with the other hazard symbols I've made...</p>
		<p>if you want to use it yourself, in things you make, just make sure
			you credit me for making it! linking back to this page would be
			best, and the name "yaodema" is what I go by almost everywhere
			online</p>
		<p>one thing to note: <strong>do not sell the symbol by
			itself.</strong> it's fine to put the warning on things in your art
			where it'd be appropriate, or to put the symbol prominently on a
			vial of something for a bit, and people have done this before. I've
			been quite happy with every case I've seen of it in the wild, so
			far! just, don't sell stickers or magnets or something with the
			symbol on it. thank you!</p>
		<p>(this is essentially CC-BY, but with an extra clause that forbids
			selling the symbol <em>by itself,</em> or as the whole point of the
			thing being sold.)</p>
		<p>also, if you want this tattoed on your body, go right ahead! (to
			allow this, tattoo artists are of course allowed to put the
			symbol on someone's body, if that someone requests it)</p>
		<p>hope you enjoy!</p>
